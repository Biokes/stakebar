## FEATURE #1: Diaspora Remittance Staking

### The Problem
- 10M+ Nigerian diaspora send $26B/year home
- WorldRemit/Wise charge 3-5% fees ($780M wasted annually)
- Recipients receive cash → sits idle in bank → earns 0%
- Inflation (25%) erodes value immediately

### The Solution

**User Flow:**
1. UK Nigerian: “I want to send £200 to my mom”  
2. YieldFi: “Send to mom’s YieldFi wallet (0 fees)”

4. Mom can:
   - Withdraw instantly (0 fees to Opay/Kuda)
   - Keep staked (earn ₦1,267/day)
   - Split 50/50 (₦155K cash, ₦155K staked)
5. Sender dashboard: “Mom has earned ₦15,000 this month!”
