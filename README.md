# YieldFI

Enterprise-Grade DLT Framework for Financial Inclusion and RWA Tokenization in Africa

---

## How YieldFI Works

YieldFI creates a technical "bridge" that turns a small business's future earnings (like an unpaid invoice or a savings agreement) into an immediate digital asset, which can then be used to get instant cash.

The key to understanding the YieldFI flow is that it combines two major functions: Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization (Invoice Factoring & Group Savings) and Cross-Border Liquidity.

## The Problem: Why Traditional Finance Fails Africa

Africa's financial landscape is defined by a critical paradox: high mobile money adoption alongside deep financial exclusion, capital inefficiency, and systemic risk.

| Challenge | Impact on Africans & SMEs |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| High Remittance Cost & Speed | Cross-border fees average ~6-9%, draining value from low-income families. Settlement is slow, crippling small business cash flow. |
| SME Credit/Liquidity Gap | The $400B+ gap means viable SMEs cannot finance inventory or fulfill large orders due to slow invoice payment (90+ days). |
| Lack of Formalized Credit History | The majority (unbanked) lack the data (credit score, formal assets) needed for commercial loans, trapping them in informal, high-interest lending. |
| Currency Volatility & Inflation | Local currency devaluation erodes savings and investor confidence, making dollar-denominated financial instruments inaccessible. |

## The Product: YieldFI - A Unified Financial Rail on Hedera

YieldFI is a multi-layered financial platform built on Hedera Hashgraph to create a unified, low-cost financial backbone for the continent. It links high-quality, tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) to daily financial services.

### Core Components

| Core Component | Function | Hedera Service Utilized |
|---|---|---|
| Remittance Rail & Stablecoin | Instant, near-zero-cost cross-border payments anchored to a regulated local stablecoin (e.g., NGN-S, KES-S). | Hedera Token Service (HTS): Native token issuance with compliance controls (KYC/AML). |
| Invoice NFT Factoring | Tokenizes verified SME invoices into tradable Non-Fungible Tokens (Invoice NFTs), providing immediate liquidity for the SME. | HTS (NFTs) & Hedera Consensus Service (HCS): NFT asset creation and immutable audit logging of invoice status (verification, payment). |
| Social-Proof Lending Pool | Formalizes credit for the unbanked by tokenizing verified credit data from informal groups (like Ajo/Stokvels) into a Credit Data NFT for use as collateral. | HCS: Immutable logging of granular, social-verified repayment history. Smart Contracts (EVM): Lending pool logic and collateralization. |
| Dynamic Yield Assets | Converts stablecoin remittances and RWA revenue streams into yield-bearing assets (e.g., fractionalized Invoice NFTs) for retail users. | HTS: Fractionalized tokens (fungible representation of the NFT). Smart Contracts: Automated yield distribution logic. |

## YieldFI User Flow: How an African SME Gets Cash

This process is broken into three main stages, using the example of a Small-to-Medium Enterprise (SME) needing immediate cash for a large, unpaid invoice.

| Stage | Action (SME User) | What YieldFI/Hedera Does | Result for the SME |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Asset Creation & Verification | An SME has a $10,000 invoice from a major customer, payable in 60 days. They upload it to the YieldFI mobile app. | Legal & Tech Audit: The platform verifies the invoice's legitimacy (checking the customer, goods delivered, and legal assignment). A Hash of the legally-validated invoice is permanently recorded on the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS). | The invoice is now a compliant, verifiable Real-World Asset (RWA) on the ledger, protected from double-counting fraud. |
| 2. Tokenization & Funding | The SME chooses to "sell" their verified invoice asset to get cash now, accepting a 90% advance ($9,000) from an investor. | Token Issuance: The platform uses the Hedera Token Service (HTS) to mint an Invoice NFT (a special digital token) representing the right to collect that $10,000 future payment. This NFT is transferred to the investor (liquidity provider). | The SME instantly receives the $9,000 in a Regulated Stablecoin (e.g., Africa-USDC) directly into their mobile wallet account. |
| 3. Settlement & Final Payment | After 60 days, the original customer pays the full $10,000 into a designated settlement bank account. | Automated Settlement: The platform receives the $10,000. It deducts the investor's principal and interest (e.g., $9,500 total) and transfers the remaining $500 balance back to the SME's wallet. The Invoice NFT is burned (destroyed). | The SME has $9,500 total cash (immediate $9,000 + final $500) and the investor has their principal + profit. The entire transaction is auditable on the DLT. |

## Remittance Flow: Supporting the Unbanked

For the individual user, the system also streamlines basic financial transactions, specifically targeting the high-cost remittance (money transfer) market.

| Step | User Action | YieldFI Simplified Mechanism | Key Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|
| A. Send Funds | A person in the US wants to send $100 to a relative in Nigeria. | The US user sends $100 to the YieldFI bank partner. This action triggers the bank partner to mint 100 Regulated Stablecoins on Hedera. | Near-instant, Low-Cost Send: The conversion and transfer are executed instantly on the Hedera network, not through slow, costly correspondent banks. |
| B. Receive Funds | The Nigerian relative receives a mobile notification that they have a balance of 100 Stablecoins. | The relative simply taps "Cash Out" in the YieldFI app. The platform automatically redeems the Stablecoins and deposits the equivalent Naira value into the relative's Mobile Money or bank account. | Seamless Fiat Access: The relative never "sees" the crypto; they only see the local currency in the app, providing a UX identical to Mobile Money but with faster, cheaper cross-border settlement. |
| C. Build Credit | The relative consistently joins local savings groups (Ajo / Esusu) tracked on the app. | The platform uses Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to log the weekly payments by the group, creating a Social-Proof Data NFT. | Financial Inclusion: This immutable payment history replaces a missing credit score, allowing the relative to eventually use their Data NFT to qualify for small loans on the YieldFI platform. |

## How YieldFI Solves the Problem

YieldFI leverages Hedera's unique properties and required mitigation strategies to create a robust and compliant system.

| Problem Addressed | Solution Mechanism (Finetuned for Africa) | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| High Remittance Costs | Instant settlement via Hedera-native stablecoins. Fee Abstraction: YieldFI Sponsors HBAR gas fees for the end-user, making the remittance appear free or flat-rate (paid by the platform) in local fiat. | Value retained by the user; near-instant settlement enhances business utility. |
| SME Credit Gap | Invoice NFT Factoring: SMEs gain immediate working capital (80-90% of invoice value) by selling a tokenized invoice. Data Integrity: HCS logs the hash of the invoice and its legal attestation status, making the RWA verifiable and attractive to institutional investors. | Liquidity in 5 minutes vs. 90 days. Creates a new, liquid asset class for African trade finance. |
| Unbanked Credit History | Social-Proof Lending: Group repayment data (Ajo) is formally tracked via a mobile-native app and logged immutably on HCS. This creates a portable, on-chain Credit Score/Data NFT that functions as verifiable collateral. | Formalizes the informal economy; de-risks small loans for financiers by providing a verifiable track record. |
| Regulatory & Liquidity Risk | Regulatory-First Stablecoin: NGN-S is issued by a Regulated Financial Institution Partner (e.g., Governing Council Bank). Anchor Liquidity: Institutional partners seed the DeFi pools with multi-million dollar commitments for stability, mitigating early ecosystem risk. | Institutional trust and capital are secured, ensuring stability and rapid adoption. |

## Revenue Model

The YieldFI model is designed for high-volume, low-margin transactions typical of African financial services, supplemented by high-value institutional RWA services.

| Pillar | Description | Revenue Source | Estimated Margin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transaction Fees (High Volume) | Micro-fees applied to every transaction, charged to the platform sponsor/business user, not the retail end-user (due to fee abstraction). | a) Small percentage fee on Remittance FX/Volume (~0.5%). b) Flat fee on Invoice NFT Creation/Settlement (paid by SME/Originator). | Low Margin (0.1% - 1.5%) – Scalable on millions of daily transactions. |
| Asset Origination & Servicing (High Value) | Charging a premium for the specialized, verified data required to onboard RWA into the system (factoring, lending). | a) Origination Fee (Factoring) on the Invoice NFT value (paid by the investor/buyer). b) Ongoing Data Attestation Fee (HCS logging) for RWA life-cycle management. | Medium Margin (1% - 3%) – Earned on asset-specific, higher-value transactions. |
| Liquidity Management & Yield (Institutional) | Capturing the spread between the capital cost and the final yield offered to users. | a) Spread on Stablecoin Staking Yields (difference between institutional yield and user-facing yield). b) Liquidity Provider Fees from the automated market maker (AMM) pools. | Stable Margin (1% - 2% APR) – Generated from total value locked (TVL). |
